# Face-Mask-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
Trained a custom CNN model to predict if a person is wearing a mask or not by analyzing webcam feed.
The process flow is as follows:
1) Prepare a dataset
  1a)Capture a frame containing your face with either mask/no mask, the captured frame is then cropped so that it contains only the face. For this, I use a pre-trained deep-learning-based face detection model (The .prototxt and .caffemodel file and FACE.py deploys this model 
  1b)
